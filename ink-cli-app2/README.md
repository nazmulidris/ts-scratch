## What is this?

This project is based on the [ts-ink-template](https://github.com/nazmulidris/ts-ink-template)
template repo that allows you to create CLI apps using Ink v3. Please refer to this
[README](https://github.com/nazmulidris/ts-ink-template/blob/main/README.md) in order to learn more
about the npm scripts provided, IDEA run configurations, getting template updates, etc.

## Running this executable node module

After cloning or forking this repo, you can change the `name` of your CLI app in `package.json`.
Then you can run the following commands to make your CLI app executable and be able to run it from
anywhere on your machine.

```shell
$ npm run build
$ chmod +x /dist/cli.js
$ npm link
```

## npm scripts

There are two sets of scripts, ones that just run a command once, and others that start them in
watch mode (very mich like webpack hot-reload). To run any of the following scripts you can execute
`npm run <SCRIPT_NAME>`.

### One off scripts

| Task                     | Script            | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Compiling                | `build`           | run`tsc` to generate JS files in the `dist` folder    |
| Running (no compilation) | `start`           | run the `dist/cli.js` file (make sure its executable) |
| Compiling and running    | `build-and-start` | run the `build` script, then the `dist/cli.js` file   |
| Run tests                | `test`            | run all the Jest tests (no need for compiling)        |

Notes about `start` script:

1. Make sure to mark `dist/cli.js` file as executable so that this self executing module can run.
2. To pass command line arguments you can use `npm run start -- <STUFF>`
3. You can also run `npm exec -c 'ink-cli-app <STUFF>'`.
4. Where `<STUFF>` can be:
   - `--help`
   - `-n Grogu`
   - `--name Grogu`

### Watch mode scripts (hot-reload)

| Task              | Script        | Notes                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Compile and watch | `build-watch` | run`tsc` and watch for changes                                                                |
| Run and watch     | `start-watch` | run `nodemon` & watch for changes in `ts`, `tsx`, `json` files; run `build-and-run` on change |
| All of the above  | `dev`         | Run the scripts above in parallel using `npm-run-all`                                         |

Here are some notes on how all the watching tasks work.

1. Instead of combining the steps to compile with tsc, and run the resulting JS in node, these two
   are separated and run concurrently. Each one of these separate tasks watches for its own changes.
2. [nodemon and ignoring unhandled exit code][w-1]. This prevents nodemon from exiting when there is
   an error in running the JS code. [Here's more background info on these exit codes][w-2].
3. [npm-run-all][w-3] then takes care of running these tasks in parallel and dumping their output in
   a terminal.

The [ComponentWithTimer](src/components/ComponentWithTimer.tsx) uses a React hook that should be
imported from `r3bl-ts-utils`. However, due to the fact that this Ink node module uses ESM and
`r3bl-ts-utils` uses CommonJS, that causes some big problems! The symbol `React` is actually
exported under the covers when TS code is generated into JS code in `r3bl-ts-utils` and that simply
fails in this node module which uses ESM. This is a sad side effect of using ESM which are
incompatible with CommonJS. For now, avoiding importing this `useForceUpdateFn()` function side
steps this issue.

> Since `r3bl-ts-utils` is used for "regular" React apps built using `create-react-app` it doesn't
> make sense to use ESM for it. It needs to be as universal as possible and currently CommonJS
> provides that flexibility.
