# Run configuration for project

- Add "run all tests" run configuration that runs all the tests in the `tests` folder in Webstorm

# Run tests from command line

- Run `run test` to run all the tests. You may have to press `a` to re-run all the tests if no code has changed, or no
  new tests were added since the last time this was run.
