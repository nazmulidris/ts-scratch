/**
 * This class generates a JSX.Element object that contains a Virtual DOM representation of the a
 * localized greeting for the user.
 *
 * More info on the Callable interface generatorImpl pattern used here:
 *   https://stackoverflow.com/a/20736000/2085356
 *
 * Key takeaways:
 *   1. A class can't implement the Callable interface.
 *   2. However, any member of the class can, and that member can be exposed as Callable.
 *   3. This member is exposed as a getter.
 *   4. This member can then be the only export in the module.
 *
 * In this case, the getter simply returns the reference to the 'generatorImpl' method. So we can
 * write things like `GenerateReactElement.generator(...)` instead of just
 * `GenerateReactElement.generator` (which is the normal use of a getter).
